This is the numerical code for simulating wave transformation over mangrove forests (Cox at OSU) by Proteus

In the '2D' folder, the 2D code uses 'Timeseries' function to reconstruct the incident wave the same as the experimental measurement  

In the 'make_input' folder, a simple python script creates the windowed data and compares the reconstrcuted wave with the original experimental measurement  

In the 'windowed_input', there are 12 inputs that can be used to generate fairly good waves by 'Timeseries'
